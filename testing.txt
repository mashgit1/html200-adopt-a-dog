Testing 

Website tested on mobile on iPhone, Pixel, Samsung, and iPad Mini. Site is responsive and correctly showcases dog columns. 

Website tested on desktop on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox with expected results presented. 

Tested with Google Chrome Dev Tools and screen size was maneuvered to confirm page and image responsiveness. I changed size dimensions from 30% up to 150% to confirm that all images and layout are correctly working. 
CSS incorporated is working and column sizes for dog boxes on mobile and tablets are changing correctly.
